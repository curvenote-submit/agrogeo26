# Abstract

Soil structure degradation, particularly due to compaction and unstable watering regimes, poses significant challenges to sustainable agriculture. This problem is often exacerbated by inefficient irrigation management, irregular rainfall distribution, tillage processes and the cumulative effects of regular field traffic from agricultural machinery. These variables cumulatively diminish the soil's structural stability, decreasing its ability to support plant development and increasing vulnerability to erosion and productivity loss. This study aims to understand how agricultural soils respond to wetting-drying cycles under various watering regimes, with a particular emphasis on changes in soil compaction. Furthermore, it assesses the ability of seismic surveys to continually and accurately detect volumetric changes and compaction dynamics caused by these regimes. To achieve this, seismic surveys, potentially expanded to fibre-optic distributed acoustic sensing, offer significant potential for high-resolution monitoring of subsurface soil dynamics, including indicators of soil compaction and soil densification. This method may offer new opportunities and a scalable approach for real-time monitoring of soil structure and compaction changes. To improve the reliability of survey data interpretation, additional validation will be conducted through in-situ measurements at the research site and geotechnical laboratory analyses. The results of this study are expected to provide new insights into the use of seismic survey techniques for real-time monitoring of soil compaction in precision agriculture. By enabling early detection and management of compaction-related issues, these findings can support the development of more effective and sustainable soil management strategies.
